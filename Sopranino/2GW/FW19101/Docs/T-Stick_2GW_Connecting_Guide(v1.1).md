# T-Stick Connecting Guide (v1.1)

This guide will show how to connect the T-Stick to a computer running macOS. This guide was tested on macOS Mojave, but it should work on older versions. To connect on Windows or Linux machines the procedure is similar, and this guide can serve as well.

Once this process is done, the T-Stick should connect to the computer automatically as long as both the computer and the T-Stick maintain the same IP address and use the same network.

The process, after learned, should take no more than 3min.

## 1-) Enter T-Stick setup, and connect to a network:


- Turn the T-Stick on:

![Turn the T-Stick on](./images/1_Turn_T-Stick_on(v1.1).jpg "Turn the T-Stick on")

- Push the setup button to enter AP-mode. The T-Stick will then create an access point.

-  Connect to the T-Stick network:

- The setup portal should open automatically as soon as the computer connects to the T-Stick network. The page will inform the saved SSID and connection status. Click on Configuration.

- Choose the Wi-Fi network that will be used to connect the T-Stick and the computer. In this guide, we will use the _guitarami\_router_ network. Don’t forget to type the password (be
careful, the password is never hidden).

- Go to the end of the page and save your settings.

- Wait at least 5 seconds before click in __how it went__. This will take you to the main setup page.

- Check if the T-Stick is connected and if an IP was attributed to the instrument. Take note of the T-Stick IP address. Leave the portal open (do not hit __exit portal__).

## 2-) Connect your computer/device to the same network, and access the T-Stick setup though the browser:

- Connect your computer to the same network the T-Stick currently is. In your case, we will connect to _guitarami\_router_.

- Open your web browser and type the T-Stick IP address to access the setup portal using the chosen network.

![Portal browser (1)](./images/10_portal_browser_1(v1.1).jpg "Portal browser (1)")

You will see the main portal screen through the web browser. Enter “Configuration” one more time.

## 3-) Configure IP address/port to send OSC messages:

- Check the computer’s current IP (in macOS, you can hold the _Option_ key and hit the Wi-Fi icon to check that information). Copy the computer’s IP into the field “IP to send OSC messages”. Hit “Save”.

![Check computer's IP](./images/11_check_IP(v1.1).jpg "Check computer's IP")

- Wait 5 more seconds and hit __how it went__:

![How it went again](./images/12_how_it_went_again(v1.1).jpg "How it went again")

- Check if the T-Stick is connected and hit __Exit Portal__. The T-Stick will start send information after the portal closes.

![Exit portal](./images/13_exit_portal(v1.1).jpg "Exit portal")

- You can now close your browser and play the T-Stick.
